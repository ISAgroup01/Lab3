\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this lab is to design a RISCV-Lite processor.\\
Data and instruction are represented on 32 bits. The register file contain 32 registers
of 32 bits, so we need 5 bits to address them.
We have implemented a pipeline processor with 5 stages:\\
Fetch, Decode, Execute, Mem, WriteBack. \\
For simplicity, we have not implemented a Branch prediction unit and a Forward Unit.\\
So in case of dependencies, our processor is less powerful.
